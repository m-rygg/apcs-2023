# Project Proposal: 
I would like to make a Flappy Bird knock-off in Unity. This will involve learning how to use Unity 2D and how to code basic scripts in C#.

## Decomposition

This project involves the following steps:
1. Create a bird object
2. Implement RigidBody / Physics for this little bird so it falls (https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html)
3. Have this bird get boosted up when a user taps the screen
4. Make obstacles at varying heights generate and move towards the left
5. Make background sky and cloud move at a similar speed
6. Create start/end game menus
7. Have the end game menu appear when the bird hits an obstacle
8. Maybe make a little hat for the bird

## I will learn

- Basics of using Unity 2D and C#
- How to use Unity's built in physics engine
